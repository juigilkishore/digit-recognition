ML algorithms to detect a handwritten digit - 28x28 image

Plain logistic regression (without regularization). The features are computed through gradient descent alogorithm for each digit. Step size of 1E-5 and a maximum of 1000 iteration are used. The digit estimation is made based on the maximum value of the hypothesis/probability among all the digits from 0 to 9.
